# iNat Viewer

Static GitHub Pages prototype. Paste your iNaturalist API token (from
https://www.inaturalist.org/users/api_token) and your observations are shown as a
taxonomic tree (kingdom → genus → species), so closely related species sit together.

The token is cached in `localStorage`; observations and taxonomy are cached in IndexedDB so repeat visits render instantly and only fetch new observations. A debug log is available on the page.

Enable Pages: Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch `main` / root.
